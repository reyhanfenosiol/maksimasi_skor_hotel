## What is our recommendation?

Management decisions regarding implementation should consider the following:
All facility features are selected as they contribute significantly to the objective function 
R. However, hotel management may **prioritize four key facilities as branding elements: swimming pool, free internet, gym, and tennis court**.
The primary target should be family travelers, as their contribution to the rating score is more significant compared to other traveler types.

Conclusion:
For optimal Strategy, Hotel management should focus on providing a complete set of facilities (Pool, Gym, Tennis Court, Spa, Casino, Free Internet) while optimizing the highest standards for the four key facilities: swimming pool, free internet, gym, and tennis court, and primarily targeting family travelers.
Note: This strategy achieves a maximum score of 
**R=0.647**, which is the best possible outcome within the given constraints.
